In reality, the agent needs to spawn an **embedded shell** so that an interactive agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) can run and be **fully interacted with** in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there must be a **key chord to exit** from the agent/shell view. This chord must **NOT use SPC as the leader**, since space is typed naturally all the time and would constantly trigger accidental exits.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Embedded PTY/shell** — Spawn a real interactive shell (or agent process) in a PTY so the user can type, run commands, and interact with Cursor/Claude directly\n2. **Non-SPC escape chord** — Implement a dedicated key chord (e.g. Ctrl+E, Alt+E, or similar) to return from agent mode to the main app\n3. **Integration** — Wire into existing agent flow (RunAgentMsg, AgentRunner, project context)\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Bubble Tea / Lipgloss: need PTY handling for raw terminal input passthrough\n- Consider `github.com/creack/pty` or similar for PTY\n- Escape chord should be rare enough to avoid conflicts with natural typing\n\n## Factoring\n\nPTY implementation must be **well-factored to allow swapping libraries later**:\n\n- **Interface** — e.g. `PTYRunner` with `Start(ctx, cmd, size) (io.ReadWriteCloser, error)` and `Resize(size)` so the UI only depends on the contract\n- **Implementation** — a `creackPTY` (or similar) struct that implements the interface and wraps `creack/pty`\n- **Dependency injection** — pass the PTY implementation into the shell view or agent runner so it can be swapped without changing the UI code\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T14:37:41.010926-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T15:19:27.09679-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T15:19:27.09679-05:00","close_reason":"Replaced by tmux pane orchestration (devdeploy-bgt).

The Bubble Tea app runs in one pane; when the user triggers \"Agent run\" (SPC a a), the app creates a new tmux pane with a shell in the project directory instead of embedding a PTY in an overlay.\n\n## Context\n\n- **Current**: ShellView spawns bash/sh via `github.com/creack/pty`, displays output in a Bubble Tea viewport, passes keys via `keyToPTYBytes`. PTY handling lives in `internal/pty` and `internal/ui/shell_view.go`.\n- **Target**: App runs inside tmux. On SPC a a, app runs `tmux split-window` to create a new pane with a shell in the project dir. User sees both panes; tmux handles rendering. No PTY in our code.\n\n## Architecture\n\n- **Pane 0**: devdeploy (Bubble Tea TUI)\n- **Other panes**: shells, created via `tmux split-window -c \u003cworkDir\u003e`, killed via `tmux kill-pane -t \u003cid\u003e`\n- **Input**: `tmux send-keys -t \u003cpane\u003e \"cmd\" Enter` when we need to send keys (optional; user types directly in pane)\n- **\"Hide\"**: `break-pane -d` to move pane to background window; `join-pane` to restore\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n1. **Require tmux**: App expects to run inside tmux. When `TMUX` is unset, show clear message: \"Run devdeploy inside tmux (e.g. \\`tmux new -s dev\\` then \\`devdeploy\\`)\".\n2. **No embedding**: Shell output stays in tmux panes; we do not capture or display it in our UI.\n3. **Keep PTY package**: Retain for tests or future non-tmux scenarios; mark as optional/fallback.\n\n## Subtasks\n\nSee child beads.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T15:15:49.570548-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T15:43:27.39097-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T15:43:27.39097-05:00","close_reason":"All subtasks complete: tmux detection, internal/tmux package, RunAgentMsg uses split-window, hide/show panes, ShellView removed, dev-log documented.
