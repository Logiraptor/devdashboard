In reality, the agent needs to spawn an **embedded shell** so that an interactive agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) can run and be **fully interacted with** in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there must be a **key chord to exit** from the agent/shell view. This chord must **NOT use SPC as the leader**, since space is typed naturally all the time and would constantly trigger accidental exits.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Embedded PTY/shell** — Spawn a real interactive shell (or agent process) in a PTY so the user can type, run commands, and interact with Cursor/Claude directly\n2. **Non-SPC escape chord** — Implement a dedicated key chord (e.g. Ctrl+E, Alt+E, or similar) to return from agent mode to the main app\n3. **Integration** — Wire into existing agent flow (RunAgentMsg, AgentRunner, project context)\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Bubble Tea / Lipgloss: need PTY handling for raw terminal input passthrough\n- Consider `github.com/creack/pty` or similar for PTY\n- Escape chord should be rare enough to avoid conflicts with natural typing\n\n## Factoring\n\nPTY implementation must be **well-factored to allow swapping libraries later**:\n\n- **Interface** — e.g. `PTYRunner` with `Start(ctx, cmd, size) (io.ReadWriteCloser, error)` and `Resize(size)` so the UI only depends on the contract\n- **Implementation** — a `creackPTY` (or similar) struct that implements the interface and wraps `creack/pty`\n- **Dependency injection** — pass the PTY implementation into the shell view or agent runner so it can be swapped without changing the UI code\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T14:37:41.010926-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T14:50:26.581162-05:00"}

The workflow increasingly makes use of **agentic workflows**, so managing agent context, plans, and execution is a first-class concern.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Input \u0026 Navigation\n- **vim + spacemacs keybinds** — familiar modal editing and navigation\n- **Leader keys** — SPC as primary leader for command discovery\n- **Keybind hints** — after hitting SPC, show available commands as hints (discoverability)\n\n### Agent Workflow UX\n- **Live progress windows** — see everything done on your behalf in real time\n- **Abort at any time** — ability to cancel/stop agent operations mid-flight\n\n### Technical Foundation\n- **Go + Bubble Tea / Charm Bracelet** — TUI framework choice\n- **Complex UI** — invest in right abstractions to make modeling easier from the start\n\n## Phased Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- Initialize Go module with Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles\n- Establish project structure and dev-log conventions\n- Document architecture decisions for UI modeling\n\n### Phase 2: UI Abstractions\n- Design abstraction layer for complex TUI composition\n- Model: views, panels, focus management, layout\n- Consider: view stack, modal overlays, split layouts\n\n### Phase 3: Input System\n- Implement leader key (SPC) handling\n- vim/spacemacs-style keybind parsing\n- Keybind registry with command mapping\n\n### Phase 4: Keybind Hints / Help\n- Transient help view triggered after SPC\n- Context-aware hints (what's available in current mode/view)\n- Dismiss on next key or timeout\n\n### Phase 5: Agent Workflow Integration\n- Agent context management (plans, state)\n- Integration points for agent execution\n- Progress event stream\n\n### Phase 6: Live Progress Windows\n- Real-time output display for agent work\n- Scrollback, filtering, search\n- Integration with abort capability\n\n### Phase 7: Abort \u0026 Control\n- Cancel signal propagation\n- Graceful shutdown of in-flight operations\n- User confirmation for destructive aborts\n\n## Dependencies\n\nPhase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 (foundation and input)\nPhase 2 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 (agent workflow stack)\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Which Charm libraries beyond bubbletea, lipgloss, bubbles?\n- Integration targets: Cursor, Claude Code, custom agents?\n- Persistence: where do plans/context live?","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T10:11:34.602042-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T10:11:34.602042-05:00"}
