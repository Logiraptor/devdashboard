{"id":"devdeploy-7uj","title":"Resource-based project workflow","description":"# Resource-based Project Workflow\n\n**Date**: 2026-02-07\n**Status**: accepted\n\n## Overview\n\nRefine devdeploy into a glue tool for git worktrees, agent sessions, GitHub PRs, and tmux panes. Projects contain **resources** (repos from ~/workspace, open PRs). Two primary actions on any resource: **open shell** or **launch agent** (shell running `agent`). devdeploy manages the lifecycle of worktrees, tmux panes, and sessions — everything persists until explicitly cleaned up.\n\n## Core Model\n\n```\nResource (repo or PR)\n  → Worktree (created on first action, reused after)\n    → Panes (shells, agents — persist until killed)\n```\n\n### Resource Types\n\n| Type | Source | Worktree behavior |\n|------|--------|-------------------|\n| Repo | Any repo in ~/workspace | New worktree on first action (branch: devdeploy/\u003cproject\u003e-\u003crand\u003e) |\n| PR | Open PR on a project repo (via gh pr list) | Worktree with PR branch checked out; reuse if exists |\n\n### Actions\n\n| Action | Keybind | Behavior |\n|--------|---------|----------|\n| Open shell | Enter / SPC s s | Create worktree if needed, split tmux pane in worktree dir |\n| Launch agent | SPC s a | Create worktree if needed, split tmux pane running `agent` in worktree |\n\n### Session Tracking\n\n- Track multiple pane IDs per resource (not just one global agentPaneID)\n- Check pane liveness via `tmux list-panes`\n- Panes persist across project switches\n- UI shows which resources have active shells/agents\n\n### Cleanup\n\n- Remove resource: kill associated panes, optionally remove worktree\n- Project delete cleans up all resources, panes, worktrees\n\n## What Carries Forward\n\n- Project CRUD, dashboard, keybind system (SPC leader)\n- internal/tmux package (split-window, kill-pane, break-pane, join-pane)\n- gh pr list integration (devdeploy-8ni.1)\n- SPC s s / SPC s h / SPC s j keybinds\n- Tmux layout: devdeploy left, project panes right (devdeploy-8ni.5)\n\n## What Changes\n\n- ProjectDetailView becomes resource-centric with j/k selection\n- Single agentPaneID → session tracker (many panes per resource)\n- Worktrees created lazily on first action, not on repo add\n- PRs are first-class resources that create worktrees\n- \"Agent\" = shell + `agent` command, not a separate concept\n\n## Supersedes\n\ndevdeploy-8ni (remaining open tasks).

Real PR Lists in Projects\n\n**Current state**: `ProjectDetailView` hardcodes `PRs: []string{\"#42 in review\", \"#41 merged\", \"#38 open\"}`. `project.Manager.CountPRs` returns 0 with a TODO for gh integration. `newProjectDetailView` never populates PRs from any real source.\n\n**Goal**: Integrate with `gh pr list` per repo in the project. Populate both the project detail view and the dashboard PR count.\n\n**Decisions**:\n- **gh only** — No GitLab or other providers\n- **Open + recently merged** — Show both open and recently merged PRs\n- **Group by repo** — PRs displayed grouped by repo in the UI\n- **Wire CountPRs** — Dashboard PR count uses real `gh pr list` numbers\n\n---\n\n## 2. Selection and Shell Actions in Projects\n\n**Current state**: Project detail shows repos and PRs as static lists. No selection (j/k), no actions. `SPC s s` (currently SPC a a) opens a shell in the project directory only.\n\n**Goal**:\n- Make repos and PRs selectable (j/k navigation, highlight selected)\n- **Enter on selected item** opens shell: repo = shell in worktree current state; PR = `gh pr checkout \u003cn\u003e` in that repo's worktree, then open shell there\n\n**Decisions**:\n- **Repos separate from PRs** — Two selectable sections: Repos, PRs (grouped by repo)\n- **Enter = open shell** — Enter on repo → shell in worktree; Enter on PR → checkout PR branch, then shell\n- **Checkout then open** — For PR: run `gh pr checkout` in the worktree, then split pane with that cwd\n\n---\n\n## 3. Keybind: SPC a a → SPC s s\n\n**Current state**: `SPC a a` = \"Agent run\" (opens tmux pane with shell). Descriptions say \"Agent run\".\n\n**Goal**: Rename to `SPC s s` because it opens a shell. Update hints to say \"Open shell\" or \"Shell\" instead of \"Agent run\".\n\n**Submenu structure**:\n- `SPC s` = Shell submenu\n- `SPC s s` = Open shell (primary action; project dir when nothing selected)\n- `SPC s h` = Hide shell pane (was SPC a h)\n- `SPC s j` or `SPC s a` = Show/join shell pane (was SPC a s)\n\n**Files to update**: `app.go` (bindings), `keybind.go` (firstLevelSubmenuLabel), `keybinds.md`, `agent-workflow.md`, tests.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tmux Organization: Project Sections, DevDeploy Control Panel\n\n**Current state**: devdeploy runs in one pane. `SPC s s` creates a new pane via `tmux split-window -c \u003cprojectDir\u003e`. No project-specific layout. Panes are ad-hoc.\n\n**Goal**:\n- **DevDeploy always visible on the left** as a control panel\n- **Each project gets a separate section** in tmux\n- **Selecting a project** switches the right side to that project's space\n- **Panes created in the project** end up in that project's area\n\n**Decisions**:\n- **Layout: Option C** — Single window, two-pane layout: left = devdeploy, right = current project. Right side is one window per project; `select-window` switches. New shells go to current project's window.\n- **Persistent shells** — When switching projects, break current project's panes to background; restore (join-pane) when switching back\n- **Init on startup** — devdeploy creates the layout on startup if it doesn't exist\n\n---\n\n## In Scope (from Ideas)\n\n1. **Quick project switch**: `SPC p l` — Switch project window without going through dashboard\n2. **Persistent shells**: Break to background on project switch, join on return (see §4)\n3. **Wire PR numbers**: `CountPRs` uses real `gh pr list` (see §1)\n4. **Window/pane naming**: Name tmux windows by project; pane titles show repo or PR\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:15:40.416074-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-07T16:04:13.250941-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T16:04:13.250941-05:00","close_reason":"All subtasks complete or superseded.

In reality, the agent needs to spawn an **embedded shell** so that an interactive agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) can run and be **fully interacted with** in real time.\n\nAdditionally, there must be a **key chord to exit** from the agent/shell view. This chord must **NOT use SPC as the leader**, since space is typed naturally all the time and would constantly trigger accidental exits.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Embedded PTY/shell** — Spawn a real interactive shell (or agent process) in a PTY so the user can type, run commands, and interact with Cursor/Claude directly\n2. **Non-SPC escape chord** — Implement a dedicated key chord (e.g. Ctrl+E, Alt+E, or similar) to return from agent mode to the main app\n3. **Integration** — Wire into existing agent flow (RunAgentMsg, AgentRunner, project context)\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Bubble Tea / Lipgloss: need PTY handling for raw terminal input passthrough\n- Consider `github.com/creack/pty` or similar for PTY\n- Escape chord should be rare enough to avoid conflicts with natural typing\n\n## Factoring\n\nPTY implementation must be **well-factored to allow swapping libraries later**:\n\n- **Interface** — e.g. `PTYRunner` with `Start(ctx, cmd, size) (io.ReadWriteCloser, error)` and `Resize(size)` so the UI only depends on the contract\n- **Implementation** — a `creackPTY` (or similar) struct that implements the interface and wraps `creack/pty`\n- **Dependency injection** — pass the PTY implementation into the shell view or agent runner so it can be swapped without changing the UI code\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T14:37:41.010926-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T15:19:27.09679-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T15:19:27.09679-05:00","close_reason":"Replaced by tmux pane orchestration (devdeploy-bgt).

{"id":"devdeploy-bgt","title":"Refactor: Use tmux pane orchestration instead of embedded PTY shell","description":"# Tmux Pane Orchestration Refactor\n\n## Overview\n\nReplace the current PTY-based ShellView overlay with tmux pane orchestration. The Bubble Tea app runs in one pane; when the user triggers \"Agent run\" (SPC a a), the app creates a new tmux pane with a shell in the project directory instead of embedding a PTY in an overlay.\n\n## Context\n\n- **Current**: ShellView spawns bash/sh via `github.com/creack/pty`, displays output in a Bubble Tea viewport, passes keys via `keyToPTYBytes`. PTY handling lives in `internal/pty` and `internal/ui/shell_view.go`.\n- **Target**: App runs inside tmux. On SPC a a, app runs `tmux split-window` to create a new pane with a shell in the project dir. User sees both panes; tmux handles rendering. No PTY in our code.\n\n## Architecture\n\n- **Pane 0**: devdeploy (Bubble Tea TUI)\n- **Other panes**: shells, created via `tmux split-window -c \u003cworkDir\u003e`, killed via `tmux kill-pane -t \u003cid\u003e`\n- **Input**: `tmux send-keys -t \u003cpane\u003e \"cmd\" Enter` when we need to send keys (optional; user types directly in pane)\n- **\"Hide\"**: `break-pane -d` to move pane to background window; `join-pane` to restore\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n1. **Require tmux**: App expects to run inside tmux. When `TMUX` is unset, show clear message: \"Run devdeploy inside tmux (e.g. \\`tmux new -s dev\\` then \\`devdeploy\\`)\".\n2. **No embedding**: Shell output stays in tmux panes; we do not capture or display it in our UI.\n3. **Keep PTY package**: Retain for tests or future non-tmux scenarios; mark as optional/fallback.\n\n## Subtasks\n\nSee child beads.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T15:15:49.570548-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T15:43:27.39097-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T15:43:27.39097-05:00","close_reason":"All subtasks complete: tmux detection, internal/tmux package, RunAgentMsg uses split-window, hide/show panes, ShellView removed, dev-log documented.

The workflow increasingly makes use of **agentic workflows**, so managing agent context, plans, and execution is a first-class concern.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Input \u0026 Navigation\n- **vim + spacemacs keybinds** — familiar modal editing and navigation\n- **Leader keys** — SPC as primary leader for command discovery\n- **Keybind hints** — after hitting SPC, show available commands as hints (discoverability)\n\n### Agent Workflow UX\n- **Live progress windows** — see everything done on your behalf in real time\n- **Abort at any time** — ability to cancel/stop agent operations mid-flight\n\n### Technical Foundation\n- **Go + Bubble Tea / Charm Bracelet** — TUI framework choice\n- **Complex UI** — invest in right abstractions to make modeling easier from the start\n\n## Phased Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- Initialize Go module with Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles\n- Establish project structure and dev-log conventions\n- Document architecture decisions for UI modeling\n\n### Phase 2: UI Abstractions\n- Design abstraction layer for complex TUI composition\n- Model: views, panels, focus management, layout\n- Consider: view stack, modal overlays, split layouts\n\n### Phase 3: Input System\n- Implement leader key (SPC) handling\n- vim/spacemacs-style keybind parsing\n- Keybind registry with command mapping\n\n### Phase 4: Keybind Hints / Help\n- Transient help view triggered after SPC\n- Context-aware hints (what's available in current mode/view)\n- Dismiss on next key or timeout\n\n### Phase 5: Agent Workflow Integration\n- Agent context management (plans, state)\n- Integration points for agent execution\n- Progress event stream\n\n### Phase 6: Live Progress Windows\n- Real-time output display for agent work\n- Scrollback, filtering, search\n- Integration with abort capability\n\n### Phase 7: Abort \u0026 Control\n- Cancel signal propagation\n- Graceful shutdown of in-flight operations\n- User confirmation for destructive aborts\n\n## Dependencies\n\nPhase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 (foundation and input)\nPhase 2 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 (agent workflow stack)\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Which Charm libraries beyond bubbletea, lipgloss, bubbles?\n- Integration targets: Cursor, Claude Code, custom agents?\n- Persistence: where do plans/context live?","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T10:11:34.602042-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T15:46:54.981985-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-06T15:46:54.981985-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
