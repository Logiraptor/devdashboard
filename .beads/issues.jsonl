{"id":"devdeploy-i1u","title":"DevDeploy: Engineer Workflow TUI with Agent Support","description":"# DevDeploy: Vision and Long-Term Roadmap\n\n**Date**: 2025-02-06\n**Status**: proposed\n\n## Philosophy\n\nDevDeploy exists to **aid engineers in their day-to-day workflow** of designing, writing, reviewing, deploying, and testing code. The workflow increasingly makes use of **agentic workflows**, so managing agent context, plans, and execution is a first-class concern.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Input \u0026 Navigation\n- **vim + spacemacs keybinds** — familiar modal editing and navigation\n- **Leader keys** — SPC as primary leader for command discovery\n- **Keybind hints** — after hitting SPC, show available commands as hints (discoverability)\n\n### Agent Workflow UX\n- **Live progress windows** — see everything done on your behalf in real time\n- **Abort at any time** — ability to cancel/stop agent operations mid-flight\n\n### Technical Foundation\n- **Go + Bubble Tea / Charm Bracelet** — TUI framework choice\n- **Complex UI** — invest in right abstractions to make modeling easier from the start\n\n## Phased Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation\n- Initialize Go module with Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles\n- Establish project structure and dev-log conventions\n- Document architecture decisions for UI modeling\n\n### Phase 2: UI Abstractions\n- Design abstraction layer for complex TUI composition\n- Model: views, panels, focus management, layout\n- Consider: view stack, modal overlays, split layouts\n\n### Phase 3: Input System\n- Implement leader key (SPC) handling\n- vim/spacemacs-style keybind parsing\n- Keybind registry with command mapping\n\n### Phase 4: Keybind Hints / Help\n- Transient help view triggered after SPC\n- Context-aware hints (what's available in current mode/view)\n- Dismiss on next key or timeout\n\n### Phase 5: Agent Workflow Integration\n- Agent context management (plans, state)\n- Integration points for agent execution\n- Progress event stream\n\n### Phase 6: Live Progress Windows\n- Real-time output display for agent work\n- Scrollback, filtering, search\n- Integration with abort capability\n\n### Phase 7: Abort \u0026 Control\n- Cancel signal propagation\n- Graceful shutdown of in-flight operations\n- User confirmation for destructive aborts\n\n## Dependencies\n\nPhase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 (foundation and input)\nPhase 2 → Phase 5 → Phase 6 → Phase 7 (agent workflow stack)\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Which Charm libraries beyond bubbletea, lipgloss, bubbles?\n- Integration targets: Cursor, Claude Code, custom agents?\n- Persistence: where do plans/context live?","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"patrick.oyarzun@grafana.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T10:11:34.602042-05:00","created_by":"Patrick Oyarzun","updated_at":"2026-02-06T10:11:34.602042-05:00"}
