# Architecture Documentation

All major architecture decisions and assumptions must be documented in `dev-log/` as markdown files.

## When to Document

Create a dev-log entry when:
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Choosing between competing approaches
- Introducing new dependencies or patterns
- Establishing conventions that affect multiple parts of the codebase

## Before Writing New Features

1. Review existing `dev-log/` entries to understand:
   - Prior decisions that may affect your implementation
   - Established patterns and conventions
   - Assumptions about the system architecture

2. Consider how the new feature fits within documented decisions

## Log Entry Format

```markdown
# Title of Decision

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: proposed | accepted | deprecated

## Context
What prompted this decision?

## Decision
What was decided?

## Consequences
What are the tradeoffs and implications?
```

## File Naming

Use descriptive names: `dev-log/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`

## Index Maintenance

When creating a new dev-log entry, **always** add it to the `dev-log/README.md` Entries table. Keep entries sorted by date (oldest first). Use the first heading (`# Title`) as the link text.
